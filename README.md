# NYC-Data: Python Final Project
# Step 1:
Datasets folder contains all the data that will be used on the project. More data will be added soon from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Transportation. We can focus on data sets on NYC transportation, health, environment, Education etc. We will have to make sure the data's aren't too noisy and only structured data about the topics above will be picked for the NYC open data site. The formats of the data is still undecided: it could be either .csv or .json we will pick the one that is easy to parse.
# Step 2:
After looking at the data and finalizing which data sets will be used in the project, We will have to come up with an agreement what kind of data we want to parse and look at? For example, if we pick the MTA subway datasat, we can collect data on all the Subways where F train in available. 
# Step 3: Project Stacks
1.  We will be using Python Matplotlib library: https://matplotlib.org/ to put the data's into a visual format so that we can present our  findings to the class.
2.  We will be using Panda's to do the analysis on the data and query/retrieve the data's that we want to be able to visualize through Matplotlib. 
# Step 4: Become familiar with the data stacks
I assume we have limited knowledge on how to actually use python libraries. So it's better to get familiar with the concepts or get better at googling what task we want to be able to perform using those libraries(eg, "How to create a pie chart using matplotlib?") 
# Finalize:
Let's plan to wrap before thanksgiving.
